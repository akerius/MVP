Hi there Proff. Pan I did have a couple of questions for you before we submitted our revised slide deck.


Before the questions I was wondering when we could meet because there is a lot of help I do need still understanding, and these are questions that we do have as a group so we would be meeting as a group. But if there is a time Monday where we could meet or zoom as a group and either ask these questions and get more help because I feel like we are almost there.


First off I had a question in terms of what method we use to detrend the data. Is there a better method between differencing or using the residuals to make our data stationary. Is one preferred over the other and why? Because I do get better values on the fuller test with residuals.


We do have zero seasonality, is that possibly because our data type is wrong in our list, do we need to set the data type as datetime and the freq as M if so how?


We still really don't know how to remove the spike we have around 2017-2018, nothing seems to make general sense, do we just keep manipulating till it goes away? What is the best practice. 


For the modeling part we have slides covering time-series, arima, dickey-fuller, and decomposition. Should we still have another slide for "explain the modeling and validation workflow".


One of my pacf plots is extremely negative, is this possible and what would this mean?


I also have more questions of EDA of our data as well as what conclusions we should draw from our models, how to test to see if these models are correct.
